## 🔌 Backend API Overview

| Module | Routes File             | Functions (Examples)              |
| ------ | ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Buyer  | `buyerRoutes.js`        | Register, View Products, Orders   |
| Vendor | `vendorRoutes.js`       | Add/Edit Products                 |
| Cart   | `cartRoutes.js`         | Add to cart, Checkout             |

## 🗄️ SQL Schema & Procedures

In `server/models/raw/`, you’ll find:

* `schema.sql` – full database schema
* `procedures.sql` – stored procedures
* `triggers.sql` – custom triggers
* `views.sql` – SQL views
* `testing.sql` – test data setup

Run these files in your local SQL Server before using the API.
